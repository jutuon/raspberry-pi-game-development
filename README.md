# Raspberry Pi Game Development

This repository contains an overview about how to develop games for Raspberry Pi and guides and scripts to setup libraries
related to game development.

## Prerequisites of Game Development
I recommend that you learn basic skills in these things first:

* Command line
* Programming and algorithms
* Basic math and trigonometry

See the Links section down below for tutorials and courses if you feel that you need some training in these things.

## Getting Started

### Development Environment

You might want to setup your Raspberry Pi first.

### Libraries

These libraries have installation instructions in this repository.

* SDL2

#### Other Libraries

These libraries work on Raspberry Pi, but don't yet have installation instruction in this repository.
